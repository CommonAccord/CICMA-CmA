Common Inter-Company Master Agreement - an incremental, modular approach to business relationships

This ProseObject can follow the course of engagement between two companies.  When they first begin discussions, they might want to assure that any disputes will be handled in an appropriate forum, that there aren't binding commitments until they are formalized, and keep a common record of their official communications.

As the relationship develops, they may want to add confidentiality engagements.  Then some deliverables.

We begin these with Step_1 and Step_2.  

This document also demonstrates how an outline can be manipulated.  It can begin small and be added to or reorganized. We use the {LI} element here, which calls for &lt;li&gt;{Sec}&lt;/li&gt;.
